## 🎯 What I Do

### Design With Data & Strategy
I combine strategic design with data-driven research to diagnose real product constraints, not assumed ones. Every recommendation is backed by user research, competitive analysis, and business impact.

### Research-Backed Decision Making
I don't redesign blindly. I research first: user interviews, behavioral data, support analytics, and market analysis. This ensures design solutions address actual problems.

### Scale Systems Through Intelligence
I design enterprise systems that evolve intelligently. Centralized, automated, and optimized for 10x growth without proportional overhead.

## 💡 Key Insights

From research across fintech, e-commerce, and enterprise:

1. **Data reveals truth, assumptions hide it** - Support tickets, usage patterns, and user research tell you the real problem. Design follows.
2. **Not every growth problem is a design problem** - Research before redesign. Maybe it's positioning, distribution, or awareness.
3. **Centralize around standards, automate exceptions** - Systems that try to handle everything collapse. Systems that standardize + automate scale infinitely.
4. **Progressive disclosure > information dumping** - Explain things when users need them, not all at once. Context is everything.
